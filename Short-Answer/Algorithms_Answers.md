#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)

I chose this because the function only has one loop. Also, the runtime depends on how large the input is which gives us a linear operation.

b) O(n^2)

I believe this would be the runttime because there are two functions nested within each other. From what I remember in class, when there are functions nessted, you multiply that function by the other's(n \* n) which gives us n^2.

c) O(n)

Like the first one, there is only one for loop. The runtime will essentially depend on how large the input is which is n. Thus, giving us a linear operation on the Big O Graph.
